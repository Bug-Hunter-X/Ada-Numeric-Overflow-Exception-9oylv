This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the failure to handle potential exceptions, specifically numeric overflow. The `bug.ada` file contains code that adds two integers and prints their sum.  However, it does not handle the `Constraint_Error` exception that can occur if the sum exceeds the maximum value of the `Integer` type.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version that demonstrates exception handling using a `begin-exception` block.
